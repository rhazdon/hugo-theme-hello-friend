# Hello Friend NG

![Hello Friend NG](https://dsh.re/d27822)



## General informations

This theme was highly inspired by the [hello-friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) and [hermit](https://github.com/Track3/hermit).


## Features

- Theming: **dark/light mode**, depending on your preferences (dark is default, but you can change it)
- Great reading experience thanks to [**Inter UI font**](https://rsms.me/inter/), made by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/about/)
- Nice code highlighting thanks to [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)
- An easy way to modify the theme with Hugo tooling
- Fully responsive
- Support for social

#### Built-in shortcodes

- **`image`** (prop required: **`src`**; props optional: **`alt`**, **`position`** (**left** is default | center | right), **`style`**)
  - eg: `{{< image src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}`
- **`figure`** (same as `image`, plus few optional props: **`caption`**, **`captionPosition`** (left | **center** is default | right), **`captionStyle`**
  - eg: `{{< figure src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Hello Friend!" captionPosition="right" captionStyle="color: red;" >}}`

#### Code highlighting

By default the theme is using PrismJS to color your code syntax. All you need to do is to wrap you code like this:

<pre>
```html
  // your code here
```
</pre>

**Supported languages**: https://prismjs.com/#languages-list

## How to start

You can download the theme manually by going to [https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git) and pasting it to `themes/hello-friend-ng` in your root directory.

You can also clone it directly to your Hugo folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git themes/hello-friend-ng
```

If you don't want to make any radical changes, it's the best option, because you can get new updates when they are available. To do so, include it as a git submodule:

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git themes/hello-friend-ng
```
### Favicon

Use [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to generate these files, put them into your site's static folder:

- android-chrome-192x192.png
- android-chrome-512x512.png
- apple-touch-icon.png
- favicon-16x16.png
- favicon-32x32.png
- favicon.ico
- mstile-150x150.png

## How to run your site

From your Hugo root directory run:

```
$ hugo server -t hello-friend-ng
```

and go to `localhost:1313` in your browser. From now on all the changes you make will go live, so you don't need to refresh your browser every single time.


## How to edit the theme

If you really want to edit the theme, you need to install Node dependencies. To do this, go to the theme directory (from your Hugo root directory):

```
$ cd themes/hello-friend-ng
```

and then run:

```
$ npm install
```

## How to add custom CSS or JS code

This theme is configured to bundle any code in assets/JS/main.js or assets/SCSS/main.scss into your website using [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/introduction/).
Simply create these folders and files and add your custom code there.
